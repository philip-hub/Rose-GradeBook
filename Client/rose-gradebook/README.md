  - Make sure the IP is associated with the rhatemyprofessors.com domain in Route53
- (On your local machine!!) Download the following keys from the Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NdcstkfMdttkovbjSILXzMnSPisy90Pl?usp=drive_link) in a couple nested places within the Private Keys Etc. folder
  - OpenGradebook1.pem
  - The following under the SSH Stuff subfolder
    - generated-private-key.txt
    - gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt
    - 934657c5454f0e53.pem
    - 934657c5454f0e53.crt
- (On your local machine!!) Navigate to downloads
- (On your local machine!!) Run the following (change the corresponding key, user, and URL to match the example SSH connection command): 
scp -i "OpenGradebook1.pem" generated-private-key.txt ec2-user@ec2-3-83-151-198.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/
scp -i "OpenGradebook1.pem" gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt ec2-user@ec2-3-83-151-198.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/
scp -i "OpenGradebook1.pem" 934657c5454f0e53.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-83-151-198.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/
scp -i "OpenGradebook1.pem" 934657c5454f0e53.crt ec2-user@ec2-3-83-151-198.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/
- SSH into the EC2 instance
